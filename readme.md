This repository is for the ppgen "post-processing generator."
This post-processing software is used to prepare books for submission to Project Gutenberg.

The principal resources for ppgen are:

* ppgen on DP Wiki: http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/PPTools/Ppgen
* ppgen team thread in DP Forum: http://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=56486

Note: If you are preparing a modification to ppgen that you intend to submit for inclusion
      in the official version of the program, please base your changes on the MergePullRequests
      branch, and create any pull requests against that branch. That will make it easier to
      validate, test, and merge your changes.
